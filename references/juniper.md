[Juniper](https://www.juniperplatform.com/) builds software for behavioral health clinicians to improve quality of care. They streamline and replace manual efforts so clinicians can focus on what they do best: providing high-quality care.

In 2022, they decided to migrate their API backend from Flask to FastAPI. To keep on track and apply the best practices of this innovative framework, I answer all the questions the development team might have through **a dedicated Slack channel**. This way of working has proved very effective as I can deliver high-quality answers with lot of details and example code snippets.
