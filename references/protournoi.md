[ProTournoi](https://www.protournoi.fr) is an online sports tournament management app.

## Key figures

* 40 000 users
* 22 000 tournaments
* 1 public instance and 2 instances for white label customers

## From a technical point-of-view

* Development of a sports tournament management app with the Symfony 2 framework in 5 months thanks to a solid experience on this techonology.
* Solving of a complexe problem of games planification on time slots and playgrounds, by developing a binary search algorithm.
* Optimization of the app speed and user experience to handle 100 users per day and pikes provoked by tournaments (up to 200 users at the same time): use of websockets to limit calls to the server, use of a scalable cloud platform (Heroku).
* Monitoring tools setup to track performance (New Relic) and errors (logs handled by Papertrail and errors reported on Slack).
