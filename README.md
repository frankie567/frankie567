I'm one of the top experts in the FastAPI community, the #3 most-used web Python framework behind Django and Flask.

In collaboration with Packt, one of the leading tech book publishers in the UK, I've wrote a book to learn all the secrets of this framework and how data scientists can leverage its power to build efficient and reliable data science applications.

Since Summer 2023, a second edition is available with updated examples and a whole new project to build your very own generative AI system!
