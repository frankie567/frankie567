## Ask me your questions

When designing new projects or during development, we sometimes need an **external point-of-view** to make sure we **take the best decision** or **help with a blocking issue**.

This is why I started my GitHub Discussions forum: **ask your questions** and **get answers** from one of the top FastAPI experts.

I'm one of the top experts in the FastAPI community, the #3 most-used web Python framework behind Django and Flask.

In collaboration with Packt, one of the leading tech book publishers in the UK, I've wrote a book to learn all the secrets of this framework and how data scientists can leverage its power to build efficient and reliable data science applications.
