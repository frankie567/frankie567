Hello, I'm **FranÃ§ois Voron** ðŸ‘‹

# Author of the best-seller book about FastAPI

<img src="https://www.francoisvoron.com/fastapi-book-v2.png?auto=format&fit=max&w=3840" alt="Building Data Science Applications with FastAPI Second Edition" height="400" align="right">

I'm one of the top experts in the FastAPI community, the #3 most-used web Python framework behind Django and Flask.

In collaboration with Packt, one of the leading tech book publishers in the UK, I've wrote a book to learn all the secrets of this framework and how data scientists can leverage its power to build efficient and reliable data science applications.

Since Summer 2023, a second edition is available with updated examples and a whole new project to build your very own generative AI system!
